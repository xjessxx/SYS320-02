# the output should be almost identical to histogram

# filter the records with this indicators of attack
# only display the unique count of IP addresses.  
# Hint: there are examples in slides

# Keep in mind that I have selected long way of doing things to 
# demonstrate loops, functions, etc. If you can do things simpler,
